1) List all images received via node input
2) Pair them with empty openpose data and render order
3) Send the first one in the list to the frontend (convert openpose data to json)
4) Frontend does something with them (adding keypoint, determining order of relations, adding a figure)
5) Receive such data and store json data
6) If "Send All" signal is made convert json data to openponse image
7) Output reference images and openpose images

>Notes
- There shouldn't be a function that draws all vertices and edges by looping through them but instead
  a function to render a given edge and a function to render a given vertex. Then there will be a data
  structure that harbors the order of edges and circles that can be re-arranged. The function will be
  iteratively applied to it. There should be a default order however that is most common (front view, person 1 < person 2).
 
- Frontend will get openpose data for 3 people, but will only see the data for more than 1 if it set it to more than 1 person.
 
- Removing a person removes the data about them as well.
 
- You can't remove the first person.
