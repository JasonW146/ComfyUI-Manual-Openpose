# Manual Openpose Setter

This is a custom node made for ComfyUI that enables users to create Openpose figures manually for batches of images.
Sometimes, and as far as I can tell more often for illustrations, Openpose estimators aren't that reliable especially when
the reference isn't that great either. For that purpose you can use this node to just do it yourself!
